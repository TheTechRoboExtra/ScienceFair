The results of my experiment indicate that yes, colour does affect both the selection of drinks and whether they taste good to people. For the most part, the average rating was improved when the subjects could not see the drinks, which lines up with the fact that the colours I used are not the most appetising, at least to me. Additionally, subject B stated after the experiment that he based which drinks he consumed first based on his knowledge of Gatorade flavours, plus subject A, for both drinks, picked purple/black first, purple being their favourite colour. This means that colour can affect the selection.

Orange was typically picked first or third, though the placements did vary. This makes sense, since the colour orange is supposed to have an attention-grabbing effect. 
Purple/black was picked first both times by subject A. This is her favourite colour, so it makes sense even without any background knowledge about purple and its related emotions. It may have also been picked first by subject C once due to him liking Coca-Cola which is black.
Green was mostly picked second or third. Since it can symbolise health and relaxation, it makes sense that it was one of the first few picked.
Blue was an unpopular first pick. I wouldn’t feel safe with a blue drink most times, so I do get why. Subject B picked it first once due to his knowledge of Gatorade flavours.
Normal apple juice was picked late into the choice; its average rating is about 3.3. Subject C commented that it looked like urine, which may be why it was picked so late.
For lemonade, normal was picked even later into the choices, its average rating being 3.6. I find it a bit strange how it was picked later, yet its average rating is higher. 
Something to keep in mind: Subject A was very hyper the second time, with subject C being rather grumpy. The food colouring may have had an effect. Additionally, I’m surprised that subject C didn’t like the lemonade. He drinks it a lot at home. Plus, the lemonade tasted bitter to C. It’s probably not due to the food colouring itself since the normal one still tasted bitter to him even though there was no food colouring in it. Finally, the other subjects liked it. So it could simply be that C was tired. 
Finally, all that talk about emotions, but emotions could be completely irrelevant here. Some scientists say about that colour/taste relationship largely depends on experience with different colours.
Still, considering that a lot of what the article about emotions says lines up at least partially with the results, I think emotions are at least a factor.

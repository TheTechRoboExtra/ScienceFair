More consistent ratings in blind test,,,,,,,

Surprising that C didn't like the lemonade - he drinks it all the time at home. Strange.,,,,,,,
Average rating was higher without sight,,,,,,,
1 of 3 subjects picked their preffered colour first for selection,,,,,,,
A was a bit hyper second time; C was a bit grumpy second time,,,,,,,
There is SOME evidence to show that colour is a factor - COULD have picked left to right. They did not. But this does not conclude anything.,,,,,,,
Subject B based selection off his knowledge of Gatorade flavours. ,,,,"Which shows that at least for them, colour DID influence selection for lemonade.",,,

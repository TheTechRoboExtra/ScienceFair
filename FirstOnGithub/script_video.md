The question is: Does the colour of drinks change whether we like them or not?

This may seem like a rather silly question but have you ever really thought about it?? I saw the idea on a science fair ideas website, and asked myself. I have some results to share.

To perform this Experiment, I got people to drink five different coloured drinks for apple juice and lemonade each that should have tasted the same.

My results indicate that colours seem to affect taste, both from sight AND from taste, which is something I did not expect in my hypothesis. I believe this is psychological as only red food colouring should really have a taste, which is very slight in any case, and I didn't notice a difference between red food coloured drinks and ones without.

BUT: If you are modifiing the docx, PLEASE!!!!!!! unzip the docx into the folder that contains the raw files. This way it's much easier for Git to understand where things go, and if there's a conflict in the binary file. and the raw files meregd successfully. I can just regenerate the docx from the raw files.
